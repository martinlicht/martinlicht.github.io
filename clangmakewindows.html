            <h2>Using Clang++ and Make natively on Windows</h2>

            This guide will explain you how to install Clang++ and Make on Windows:
            specifically, we will discuss the MinGW-w64 project. 
            <br><br>
            In my experience, getting these programs to run natively on Windows is faster than calling them from within emulation layers such as Cygwin.

            <h1>Downloads</h1>
            <ol>
                <li style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    Open your web browser and load the official project website of the MinGW-w64 project:
                    <pre class="highlight"><a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">https://www.mingw-w64.org/</a></pre>
                    Actually, we can go straight to the download section:
                    <pre class="highlight"><a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads">https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads</a></pre>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    You find several links to different packages of MinGW-w64 bundled together with compilers and additional software. 
                    This guide focuses on the LLVM package, <code>LLVM-MinGW</code>, which provides the LLVM compilers and also comes bundled with <code>make</code> and <code>Python</code> (Version >= 3.9).
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    Use the link on the website or go directly to:
                    <pre class="highlight"><a href="https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases">https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases</a></pre>
                    Here, you find Zip-files that contain the precompiled binaries, for different processor architectures and operating systems. 
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    We need to understand which version to download. 
                    A brief explanation is found on the project homepage on Github:
                    <pre class="highlight"><a href="https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw#releases">https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw#releases</a></pre>
                    We want to work on Windows directly, so we look for Zip-files called 
                    <pre>llvm-mingw-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;crt&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;.zip</pre>
                    where 
                    <ol style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;version&gt;</code>
                            - A running number that simply indicates the version of the package
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;crt&gt;</code>
                            - The C runtime library required, which is either <code>mscvrt</code> or <code>ucrt</code>. 
                            The former is the MSV C runtime, which is available on all versions of Windows but has less features.
                            The latter is the Universal C runtime, which is pre-installed from Windows 10 onwards.
                            Please note that the Zip-file will not provide that runtime library, 
                            you need to make sure that your Windows installation already provides it. 
                            For that reason, we will pick the MSV C runtime. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;arch&gt;</code>
                            - This indicates the processor architecture, which is one of the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li style="margin-top: 1em;"><code>i686</code>, which is the 32-bit architecture of Intel</li>
                                <li><code>x86-64</code>, which is the 64-bit architecture of Intel</li>
                                <li><code>armv7</code>, which is the 32-bit architecture of ARM</li>
                                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><code>aarch64</code>, which is the 64-bit architecture of ARM</li>
                            </ul>
                            The package contains binaries to compile <b>for</b> any of those architectures but these binaries only run <b>on</b> the specified architecture.
                            For that reason, you need look up which processor is being used on your machine and pick the appropriate package.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Let us suppose from now on that we have picked 64-bit Intel CPU and, just for compatibility reasons, use the MSV C runtime.
                    The version will be <code>20231003</code>.
                    You <b>must</b> adapt the following lines according to your choice of package, and likely your version number will be more advanced.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whatever you pick, download the Zip file.

            <h1>Installing and testing</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The installation begins with simply unpacking the .zip archive and transfering the folder to a convenient location. 
                    For simplicity, we choose the put our copy to the top folder folder of the main drive <code>C:\</code>.
                    All the binaries are now contained in 
                    <pre><code>C:\llvm-mingw-20231003-msvcrt-x86_64</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The most important subfolder is 
                    <pre><code>C:\llvm-mingw-20231003-msvcrt-x86_64\bin</code></pre>
                    which contains the binaries that we want to evoke.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We modify the Windows path variable. For that, we need to access the "Advanced System Settings".
                    Open the launcher and enter <code>Advanced System Settings</code>.
                    Alternatively, open <code>Control Panel</code>, then <code>System and Security</code>, then <code>System</code>, then look for <code>Advanced System Settings</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once that Windows is open, named <code>System Properties</code>, open the tab <code>Advanced</code> and click on <code>Environment Variables...</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the first list, click on <code>Path</code> and then <code>Edit...</code>.
                    Click on <code>New</code> and enter the path the binary folder. In our example, <code>C:\llvm-mingw-20231003-msvcrt-x86_64\bin</code>. Then click <code>OK</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Congratulations, we should be ready now. 
                    We can try either Git Bash, Cygwin, Windows Powershell, or the Methuselian cmd.exe. 
                    All of these load the Windows path variable
                    <ol style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
                        <li>
                            Open any of those command prompts and enter <code>clang --version</code>. That should display some self-description of Clang, including the version number.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make has a different name in this package. Open any of the aforementioned command prompts and enter <code>mingw32-make --version</code>. 
                            Again, you will receive the version output of your current make implementation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can look up any of the other commands in the binary folder if you have need for something else.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    One of word of caution: different command prompts give different priorities to different folders when looking for the command. 
                    For example, Cygwin will first look in its own internal directories for <code>gcc</code>, so if your Cygwin installations already includes GCC, then Cygwin will pick that one.
                    Typically, calling <code>make</code> in Cygwin will call the binary at <code>/usr/bin/make</code> but <code>mingw32-make</code> will be found in your Windows system.
